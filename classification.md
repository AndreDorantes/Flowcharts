# Classification

## Part 1

### Silver

1.  Explain why a developer, who is good at both low-level and high-level programming languages, would normally use a high-level language when writing programs?
 ```sh
  Because high-level lenguges have more applications, and these are less complicated than a low-level lenguage.
  ```

2.  What is machine code?
   ```sh
   Is a conjunction of codes that is interpreted by a microprossesor of a computer or a microcontroller of a automaton, is writen in binary code.
   ```

3.  Give an example of a high-level language?
   ```sh
  Phython, C++, C#.
  ```

# Gold

1.  Describe three differences between low-level language and high-level languages?
```sh
1) Low-level is closer to computer language and high-lever are closer to the user.
2) Low-lever is harder to understand.
3) Low-level lenguages do not need interpreters to work, and high-level need applications to translate to computer language.
```
 2.  What does a translator do?
 ```sh
Translate the source code to machine code.
 ```
3.  Identify two types of translators that can turn high-level languages into machine code?
```sh
Compiler and interpreter.
```

# Platinum

 1.  What is the difference between an interpreter and a compiler?
```sh
An interpreter can run code with small errors, but a compiler can not. And working with a compiler is faster than working with an interpreter.
```
2.  What is assembly language?
```sh
Is a low-level programming lenguage written for an specific processor.
```

3.  A developer is writing a program.
 a) The program is written in a high-level language and it is then translated into machine code. Describe two differences between high-level language and machine code?
 ```sh
1) High-level uses english and symbols and the machine code uses binary.
2) Machine code is more bound to the architecture of the computer.
```
 b) One type of translator is an interpreter.
i) Describe how an interpreter translates high-level language programs into machine code? (1 Mark)
```sh
It check if all the lines are correct, then it will try to execute it, and if it finds an error and it will notify you, and if it is correct it will execute it.
```
ii) State the name of a different type of translator that can be used to translate high-level code into machine code?
```sh
Compiler.
```
